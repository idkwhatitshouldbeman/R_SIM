## **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### Why These Fixes Failed:
1. **Insufficient Testing**: Changes were made without proper end-to-end testing
2. **Misunderstanding Requirements**: Split points were added to wrong location
3. **Fake Data Implementation**: Simulation results were hardcoded instead of real
4. **Incomplete Fixes**: Partial implementations that didn't address root causes
5. **No User Validation**: Changes weren't tested from user perspective

### Critical System Failures:
- **Drag & Drop**: Core functionality broken
- **Motor System**: Attachment system fundamentally flawed
